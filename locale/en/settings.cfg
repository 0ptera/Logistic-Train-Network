ltn-interface-console-level=Detail level of in game messages.\n\n0: Off\nNo messages will be generated.\n\n1: Errors & Warnings\nPrint only errors and warnings.\n\n2: Notifications (default)\nPrint basic information like missing resources or generating deliveries.\n\n3: Detailed Messages\nPrint detailed information about finding providers and trains.
ltn-interface-message-filter-age=Message age in ticks before filtered messages are shown again.\ndefault = 18000
ltn-interface-factorio-alerts=Show errors and warnings as Factorio alerts
ltn-interface-debug-logfile=Write debug information to /Factorio/factorio-current.log.

ltn-dispatcher-enabled=Warning: Deactivating Dispatcher stops delivery generation.\nItem levels will still be monitored.
ltn-dispatcher-nth_tick=How fast stops and requests are updated.\nHigher numbers improve performance by spreading out updates over more ticks.\nWhen set > 1 forces Updates per tick to 1.
ltn-dispatcher-updates-per-tick=Limits the number of stops and requests updated per tick.\nLower numbers increase performance.\nIgnored when Update frequency > 1.
ltn-dispatcher-requester-threshold=Missing amount of items/fluids triggering a delivery.\nCan be overridden with signal at requesting stops.\ndefault = 1000
ltn-dispatcher-provider-threshold=Amount of items/fluids required to act as provider.\nCan be overridden with signal at providing stops.\ndefault = 1000
ltn-dispatcher-schedule-circuit-control=Adds circuit conditions to wait for red = 0 OR green â‰¥ 1 to all stops.\nWarning: All LTN stops require having "send to train" enabled and a circuit connection. Otherwise trains will be stuck waiting forever.\ndefault = false
ltn-dispatcher-depot-inactivity(s)=Duration in seconds of inactivity before trains leave the depot.\ndefault = 5
ltn-dispatcher-stop-timeout(s)=Duration in seconds before trains are forced out of a station.\n0 deactivates this feature.\ndefault = 120
ltn-dispatcher-delivery-timeout(s)=Duration in seconds deliveries can take before assuming the train was lost.\ndefault = 600 (10min)
ltn-dispatcher-requester-delivery-reset=False: (default)\nDelivery and schedule are reset when train arrives at depot.\nChanges to trains parked at requesting stops have no effect.\n\nTrue:\nDelivery and schedule are reset when train leaves requester.\nChanges to trains parked at requesting stops will remove delivery and reset schedule.
ltn-dispatcher-finish-loading=True: (default)\nPrevents trains from leaving while inserters/pumps are working by adding 2s inactivity condition.\n\nFalse:\nTrains will leave immediately when all items have been loaded.\nInserters at loading stations will get stuck.
ltn-dispatcher-create-temporary-stops=True: (default)\nCreates temporary stops to force trains to drive to the correct train stop if there are multiple train stops with the same name.\n\nFalse:\nNo temporary stops are created. This may be useful for loadbalancing but can lead to trains driving to the wrong train stop if there is accidentally another one with the same name.
ltn-depot-reset-filters=True: (default)\nCargo wagons have their filters and stack limitations cleared when entering a depot.
ltn-depot-fluid-cleaning=Maximum amount of fluid per wagon automatically destroyed when entering depots.\nSet to 0 to disable.
ltn-stop-default-network=Network ID used for stops without "Encoded Network ID" signal.
